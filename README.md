Surprise Highway Base ExpressionEngine Skeleton
===================

This is the basic directory structure, configuration and default templates that we use for all of our ExpressionEngine sites. We're not claiming this is the ultimate setup, just documenting how we do it. We're constantly improving and expanding on it. If you have ideas for improvement please fork and send a pull request or drop us an email at [team@surprisehighway.com](mailto:team@surprisehighway.com)

Things we've tweaked
-------------------

* Moved system above docroot for security
* Moved third_party and config outside of the system folder for easier upgrades
* Using NSM Bootstrap Config for easily moving sites between environments
* Added commonly used templates for pages, header, footer, 404, etc
